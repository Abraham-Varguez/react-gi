# react-gi

To make the React app I used Vite

instead of doing "npx create-react-app" to create the React App

You will use "npm create vite" instead

Once you run the commans and name it, where I named it "gi-react"

It will ask you what framework: I selected "React"

then what Variant: I selected "Javascript"

Once the folder is created you will need to run "npm install" to add all 3rd party packages

next you will cd into gi-react folder

then you will run "npm run dev" to start the server

it will automatically be hosted on 'http://localhost:5173/' when you start up the first time
